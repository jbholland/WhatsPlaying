## About the app
This application generates links to Wikipedia for the currently playing song, artist and album in Apple Music on the iPhone. These links may or may not work, as it tries to anticipate the needed link based on the song's meta information. If the links work, the Wikipedia app (if present) is opened on the page, or else the page is opened in a browser. It does not record or transmit any data about the user in any way.
